## 2.4. Compare two-way data binding vs one-way data flow.

With one way data binding form data is only getting updated when you change the data on parent level. So it's accepting data only form parent and will not update data when something changed in a form. In order to update that data you have to listen for input value change and apply data change manually.
With two way data binding it will be updated automatically.
Sometimes it is handy but can have side effects as well.
For example if you want to implement inline search, you don't want to save search term in a data model and instead most likely you will directly make a search query with the search term.
