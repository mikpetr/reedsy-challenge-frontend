## 2.1. What kind of front end projects do you enjoy working on? Why?

It may sound strange :), but I enjoy working on early stage SaaS projects when there are still a lot of things getting changed. I already gained some knowledge about how to develop them, how to keep balance between new features and technical debt, and how to deal with urgent customer needs. I already know how to work with it and I really enjoy seeing how it affects users in practice.
