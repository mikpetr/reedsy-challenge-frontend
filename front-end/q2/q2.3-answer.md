## 2.3. Explain the difference between creating a DOM element setting `innerHTML` and using `createElement`.

Main difference is that if we use innerHTML it rerenders all content of the element. If we use `createElement` and use `appendChild` method browser renders only created element. So `createElement` is faster than `innerHTML`.

Also `createElement` is more secure as it does't require a whole working HTML code and instead you just specify tag name while with `innerHTML` whatever is given will be executed by the browser.
