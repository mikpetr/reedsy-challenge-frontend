## 1. Tell us about one of your commercial projects with Vue.js or AngularJS.

My last project (REO) is with Nuxt.js. It is a CRM tool for real estate agents with the mission to provide all necessary tools for interaction and communication with their clients.

I was leading a Front End team there and mostly I made impact on the architecture of the project. During my time there beside of developing new features I was working to improve app stability and performance.
